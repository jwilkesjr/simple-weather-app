# Weather App

This project is a weather application that lets users search for and display the current weather conditions of a specific location. The app is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data.

## Features

- The app allows users to enter a location into a search box and displays current weather conditions for that location. This includes data such as temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed.
- The app is responsive and adjusts its layout to accommodate different device screen sizes.
- The app features robust error handling. If a user enters an invalid location or if there's an error with the API, a friendly error message is displayed.
